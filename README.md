This is a D3D11 graphics engine I made to introduce myself to the world of graphics programming  
There's some cool stuff here but a lot of things aren't very optimal or intuitive   
If you want to see more competant graphics programming take a look at "Alkali Engine", my D3D12 engine which I'm still working on as of 2024  

Here are some of the features I implemented into this engine:  
  - Wavefront Obj model loading  
  - TGA texture loading  
  - Normal Mapping  
  - Basic shadow maps  
  - GPU particle systems  
  - Fire shader using noise  
  - Sum-of-sines ocean simulation shaders  
  - Tessellation shader support  
  - Portals using display planes  
  - Frustum Culling  
  - Reflection and refraction  
  - Skyboxes  
  - Bitmaps and custom UI/Text rendering  
 
Controls:  
  - WASD to move the camera left/right/forward/backward  
  - QE to move up/down  
  - ZX to rotate left/right  
  - C + WASD to rotate the camera in other directions  
  - R to reset the camera  
  - Space Bar to swap scenes  
  - Escape to quit  
  - 1 to activate showcase settings  
  - 2 to activate debug settings  
  - 3 to activate post processing settings  
  - 4 to activate high performance settings    
  - 5 to activate fog settings  
  - 6 to activate wireframe mode settings
